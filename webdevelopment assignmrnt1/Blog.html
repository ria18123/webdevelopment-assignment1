      <p>This article explains how to create the index.html file for a website. The web page was first built using the normal HTML format, and a stylesheet was made to style it. Next, we started building the menu that is shown at the top of the page, also known as the header. In addition to the menu, we also designed a hamburger icon and navbar so that the website may automatically resize and display itself in a smaller format when it is responsive. When the hamburger icon is clicked, a navigation bar containing the website's menu appears. The menu elements also link to various subpages, such as contact, portfolio, report, blog, etc., that, when clicked will take you to the clicked subpage or home page.</p>

      <p>This article details the process I used to develop my contact, portfolio, report, and blog pages. I started constructing the portfolio page after finishing the home page. First, I wrote the title at the top and made a grid with six boxes. Next, I added sliders on top of the grid box, which will hold images for any future projects. The text for the image's title and description can be written inside the slider, but for now, I added dummy images inside the boxes that were produced by the site's dummy image generator.Following that, I began making a contact me page, which is accessible via the contact button on the homepage and merely has a contact form. A area for entering information has been created inside the contact form, and a submit button has been added at the bottom. The report page was made after the portfolio page, and a box was made for the report to be presented within of. The report's title was added at the top, and margins with the paragraph's title in green color were made to highlight and distinguish the paragraph. After the report's body was written, photos containing the screenshot were added at the end.Then I created the blog page, which has a wide image with the title in the center at the top and irregular columns to divide it into two sides (the left side contains the articles and the right side contains boxes like "about me," "popular articles," and "follow me" that contain social media icon boxes). Finally, a footer is added at the bottom of the blog.</p>

      <p>The debugging and validation process are covered in this article. Debugging was a simple process, and I discovered that it is much simpler to do when constructing the page rather than after all the pages have been built, which also helps to keep the process orderly. I checked my codes in the browser after creating each page of the website. Many of the mistakes I made while designing this website were found thanks to this procedure. All the codes were validated through the w3c markup validation service</p>
