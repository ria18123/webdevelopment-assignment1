       This report outlines all the actions I did to create this website, as well as the mistakes I made. I sourced a lot of my references for this website from websites like w3 and Youtube. Through online research and watching lessons on YouTube, I discovered a lot of fresh information about the creation of websites. The majority of the coding that I didn't know came from Google sites like w3 geeks for geeks and lessons on youtube. After my assignment has been evaluated, I hope to further cut down on my errors and improve my web programming abilities.The homepage (index.html), which serves as the website's introduction, and the style page (styles.css), where all subsequent pages and subpages would be formatted, served as the starting points for the website's creation.
      <br>
     This report details every step involved in building the html and CSS pages and subpages. This assignment was designed to test our proficiency in using GitHub to manage our code and to construct a responsive website that can function on both desktop computers and mobile devices. Understanding how to do this will enable us to build a website that will help us reach the largest possible audience. I began my assignment by first developing the fundamental home page and CSS. I began creating and designing the home page with html(index.html) and styling with css(style.css). I had to go through a lengthy, step-by-step procedure to style the home page using CSS because I wasn't sure how I wanted it to look.

<div class="home">
    <div class="home-head blue">
        <h2>1. Creating the hamburger menu and the Home page :</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
          Before creating the home page the menu bar was first created inside the header the menu bar is located at the top of the webpage and contains menu-items i.e subpages like: index.html which is the homepage, contact.htm, report.html, portfolio.html and blog.html. The menu-items are later linked wih their subsequent webpages so that when clicked on it it would link the user straight to that subpage.Since the home page should be accessible from other webpages and vice versa the hamburger menu was then created. A hamburger icon and navbar is then added so that when the browser is minimized or the website is uded in a mobile it can still be functional and responsive. To create the hamburger menu first div class container and wrapper were added then below the nav class navbar was added inside where the menu would be. Division class hamburger menu had three div class lines and the nav list contained the names of the subpages. When the browser shrinks the menu bar at the top of the webpage also shrinks into a hamburger icon and when the hamburger icon is clicked a navbar appears covering the screen .It consists of all the menu-items and when you hover above the menu item the color changes. I also made the menubar at the top of the webpage transparent. The hamburger is functional wit te help of javascript(main.js). After this process the home page is created.Java script (script.js) was used to create the retractable effect of change after clicking the animated hamburger icon which was created by styling change and div class line (1, 2 and 3).
          <br>
          While creating the homepage the basic html code was first written and was linked to the stylesheet or the style page so that the homepage could be styled later on. The background image was then selected from google at the website unsplash.com where free images are available. In the middle of the home page a welcome text (Hi! I am riya) below the dic class head and below that inside the div welcom e-text a dynamic text (WELCOME TO MY WEB SITE) was added .I made this text so that it would disappear automatically when hovered above it. I made the dynamic text so that it automatically start to generate and disappear. Creating the animated hamburger was the most cumbersome process of the whole website.The font for the website was added from google fonts. The styling was done in styles.css where the image was added to the div parallax1, the width and the height of the navbar was selected along with the transition and position,and the background of the navbar to be dark grey. To make the webpage responsive @media (max-width: 1023px) for tablets and @media (max-width: 767px) was used for mobile phones. The index page was then validated at w3c markup validation service .

         For blog page a header_B div was first created which contains a wide dummy image inside it and the title of the blog at the centre of the image at the top of the webpage .At the middle section of the webpage irregular columns are used to divide the webpage into two sides (the left side which contains the articles and the right side which contains boxes like "about me," "popular articles," and "follow me" box that contain social media icons) and Finally, a footer is added at the bottom of the blog.

            For portfolio div class image grids were first made where placeholders or dummy images were placed inside the webpage using grid.After that the title was written at the top of the webpage and a grid consisting of with six boxes was created. Next, sliders were added on top of the grid box, which will hold images for any future projects. The text for the image's title and description can be written inside the slider, but for now, I added dummy images inside the boxes that were produced by the site's dummy image generator. The images were added to div class “image-grid” in the html page. Then it was made responsive at style.css so that it can function in both mobile and laptop and styled at styles.css and then the debugging process was done by inspecting the webpage. After that the webpage was validated at w3c markup validation service.

Division class container and contact info was made and icons were added inside the div class box-x from font-awesome. The contact info was added inside the div class text Then to create the contact form heading send messages was written and the questions like full name, email and type your message was written inside the div class input box. It was styled at style.css and validated at w3c markup validation service.
            Another CONTACT ME.html page was also created which can be accessed through the contact me button which ids located inside the home page. This page only contains the contact form and no contact information section so the user can type their info inside the input box and type any messaes and send it directly. It was styled at style.css and validated at w3c markup validation service.

                This report is a reflection on all the new thins and lessons i learned while crating this website .It was a great learning process for me Since it was a long trial and error process for me. Summing up the things I learned from my lectures and putting it in the website was a huge boost to my confidence in while and in this process there are still a lot of things that I learned and things i hope I to do further in the future while create websites. There are still a lot of errors in this assignment that I hope I can prevent and reduce in the future.
